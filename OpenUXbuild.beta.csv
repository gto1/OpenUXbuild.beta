,,,,,,,,,
,,"Panels (module) -- Drupal’s block system can be really cumbersome to work on, as your site gets more and more complex. You may want fine grain control over the way your page is displayed-if not now, then may be later. Panels is an alternative to Drupal’s default block system.",,,,,,,

,,"Site Access Module (module) -- Content people, managers, etc. allows for powerful custom workflow who can view what",,,,,,,
,,"Webform (module) -- adds a webform as a nodetype which allows you to offer register forms, surveys, polls and much more. It’s also a good alternative to Drupal’s site-wide contact form.",,,,,,,
,,Advanced Forum (module) — adds more robust functions for drupal core forums,,,,,,,
,,"Nodewords (module) -- Nodewords is great for SEO because it allows you to set meta tags for each drupal page or node. This gives you awesome control over what keywords and descriptions are used on each page of your site, and if used correctly can really help your rankings. It helps out with SEO and keeps google’s attention by constantly updating content with new keywords.",,,,,,,
,,"(Alt.) Metatag (module) allows one to have complete control over the characteristics of a page. For example, you may configure a page title, description metatag, canonical tag, author and publisher markups, robots meta-tag, and many more things on a site wide, page type based and custom basis. This module is a must have irrespective of your site because this allows you to configure your page for search engines. Search engine traffic is a must have for most websites and without this, it is highly unlikely that you get some.",,,,,,,
,,Token - Metatag requires Token (module),,,,,,,
,,XML Sitemap (module) -- Google’s webmaster guidelines say that you should create an XML sitemap and submit it regularly to Google for the proper indexing of your page. The XML sitemap module combines it with cron job and regularly updates your sitemap and submits it to search engines. You can decide what should be there in the sitemap and what should not be. Adding parameters such as priority is just a breeze.,,,,,,,
,,"Pathauto (module) --- By default, any content at Drupal is given URLs like these: yoursite.com/node/123123. These URLs are neither human friendly nor search engine friendly. Pathauto allows one to specify alternative URLs to pages. These URLs can be generated based on a preset pattern using Token, or they can be edited at a per node basis at the content creation form. So you can easily replace default URLs of your sites with yoursite.com/title-of-your-content. This is a must do from SEO point of view as human friendly URLs are one among the standard SEO practices.",,,,,,,

,,"Build out a full HTML, CSS, Js version of the site (referred to hereafter as the “html site”). Get this up and running.",,,,,,,
,,Make a backup or two of the html site for safe keeping.,,,,,,,
,,Install and get running a plain vanilla latest Drupal instance with basic theme running in development environment. (istdrupaldev.ist.psu.edu),,,,,,,
,,Create a new custom theme folder in the Drupal site file system at /sites/all/themes/new_theme_name and name it whatever you want. This should be the name of your new custom theme.,,,,,,,
,,"Copy the html site's index.html (or index.php, etc.) file into the new Drupal theme folder and rename it page.tpl.php.",,,,,,,
,,"The page.tpl.php file starts after the <body> tag and ends before the </body> tag, so you do not need to worry about the doctype, html, or head tags.",,,,,,,
,,"Delete these lines of code from the page.tpl.php to clean out some unneeded, redundant code.",,,,,,,
,,"This is the recommended way to start your page, rather than just using <html>.",,,,,,,
,,Copy the html.tpl.php file from your Drupal modules/system folder to your new custom theme folder and make whatever changes you'd like.,,,,,,,
,,CSS — Copy your css directory into the new Drupal theme in same directory as page.tpl.php and html.tpl.php.,,,,,,,
,,"Add your stylesheet link tags to the html.tpl.php file in the <head> section, path is relative to the site root.",,,,,,,
,,"Example: <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""/sites/all/themes/blue_whale/css/theme.css"">",,,,,,,
,,Js — Copy your Js folder and files into the new Drupal theme in same directory as page.tpl.php and html.tpl.php.,,,,,,,
,,In html.tpl.php make sure your Js paths are relative to the site root.,,,,,,,
,,"Example: <script src=""/sites/all/themes/blue_whale/js/vendor/jquery.1.11.1.js""></script>",,,,,,,
,,The Js should be working on the Drupal site because you had it working right in the html site. Double check your file paths if needed. — Something to look at might be putting Js into $page_bottom for faster load times and to get it out of page.tpl.php.,,,,,,,
,,jQuery — same as Js.,,,,,,,
,,Images — Copy your img folder and files into the new Drupal theme in same directory as page.tpl.php and html.tpl.php.,,,,,,,
,,Make sure your img paths are relative to the site root.,,,,,,,
,,"Example: <img src=""/sites/all/themes/blue_whale/img/hp-carousel-1.jpg"" alt="""">",,,,,,,
,,Fonts — Copy your fonts folder and files into the new Drupal theme in same directory as page.tpl.php and html.tpl.php.,,,,,,,
,,Make sure your font paths are relative to the site root.,,,,,,,
,,"Create a custom_theme.info file - Like all Drupal themes, your custom theme needs a theme_name.info file. To create your own for your new theme, simply create a new text file, name it your_theme_name.info (no spaces allowed) and populate it with the following code:",,,,,,,

If you want to add custom regions, you must manually include any of the default ones you wish to keep as well or the defaults will disappear from your theme (simply copy/paste them from this page or another theme).

It is helpful to have a browser window up with the html site running to make sure you have all parts in place and showing up/functioning in the new Drupal site. Using Firebug to find missing items is very helpful at this stage.",,,,,,,

,,Follow these steps to add the dynamic menu system including navigation.,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,"[This is probably Drupal 6 —> ] Drupal's default menu for your site's content is called Primary Links. There is also a Secondary Links menu which can show related sub-pages under the Primary menu. When stripped of all images and styles, a menu in Drupal is nothing more than a nested unordered list, in plain HTML, with links for each list item. You can use CSS to style a menu in any way you want; changing how it looks, whether it is horizontal (like tabs) or vertical, etc.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,"To make the Primary and Secondary Links menus appear on your site, paste the following into either the top area of your theme (for instance, if your menu is going to be styled as tabs or buttons), or in the sidebar area (for instance if you plan to have your menu show vertically in the sidebar).",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,"Simple way: Here's the simple version to use, if you're already sure you want to use ""both"" Primary and Secondary Links (or feel free to delete the Secondary Links portion if you don't need it):",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,"<div id=""primary"">",,,,,,,
,,"<?php print theme('links', $primary_links); ?>",,,,,,,
,,</div> <!-- /#primary -->,,,,,,,
,,"<div id=""secondary"">",,,,,,,
,,"<?php print theme('links', $secondary_links); ?>",,,,,,,
,,</div> <!-- /#secondary -->,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,"More flexible way: If you're not sure that you will have both Primary and Secondary Links, you could use the following code instead (it's the same, but just does a ""check"" to see if the menus are enabled, and only shows them if they are):",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,<?php if ($primary_links): ?>,,,,,,,
,,"<div id=""primary"">",,,,,,,
,,"<?php print theme('links', $primary_links); ?>",,,,,,,

KEYWORDS,,,,,,,,,
0/0/14,,SEO Google Webmaster Tools,,,,,,,
,,SEO Checklist (m) ,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,My master SEO checklist,"SEO helps in improving SER in all major leading Web search engines including Google, Bing, Yahoo, and Baido (China). The following is a report of what is currently being done by the Office of IT since mid-2012 to the present to optimize ist.psu.edu for internal (searching within the site) and external (searching externally with an outside search engine for/to the site) search and, therefore, search engine rankings.",,,,,,
,,SEO (internal),,,,,,,Our site uses the stock Plone CMS to optimize the site for internal search. Many of the practices included below for external search are implemented for and aid in optimizing internal search.
,,,,,,,,,
,,SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION (SEO) PRACTICE,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,Google (other engines) knows the site,,,,,,,
,,"Good IA, Googlebots have site map, crawl site well",,,,,,,
,,Page Load Time: 0.00 Seconds,,,,,,,
,,"Alt tags (unique, accurate)",,,,,,,
,,"Title tags (unique, accurate)",,,,,,,
,,Head tags,,,,,,,
,,"Meta tag Descriptions, <=160 words, each page",,,,,,,
,,Optimizing Content,Write better anchor text to match desired affinity keywords,,,,,,
,,,Needs to be specified and continued actively by content providers.,,,,,,
,,,EXAMPLE: searching Google for “IST” results in #1 ranking,,,,,,
,,,EXAMPLE: searching Google for “information science college” results in #5 ranking,,,,,,
,,Meta tag keywords (depricated),Google doesn't use keywords (http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=79812),,,,,,
,,,"Bing uses them only as a spam signal, not for ranking",,,,,,
,,,Yahoo doesn't use at all,,,,,,
,,Key terms density,"Keyword density: Some search engines examine keyword density. The designer should ensure that keywords in the site appear frequently in the content. Keywords should be included in the alternative text, titles, headings, table headings, and throughout paragraphs when you work with a page’s subject matter and content. Other strategies may include naming images, folders, and pages after keywords.",,,,,,
,,Anchor vocabulary in site,"Anchor keywords are used to capitalize on the benefits of keywords and inbound links. Try to use keywords as links that can be found in the flow of a paragraph. If the user clicks on a keyword, the user is redirected to a section of the site where further details about the keyword are highlighted. If, for example, you design a site about widgets and include “blue widgets” as one type of product that is offered, create a link for the blue widgets keyword that will take the user to the associated product page. This is beneficial for SEO as well as for usability. Part of the reason Wikipedia appears at the top of many search engine results is because it anchors its keywords.",,,,,,
,,Make effective use of robots.txt,,,,,,,
,,"Good (readable, accurate) URLs (Plone)",,,,,,,
,,"Be aware of rel=""nofollow"" for links (Plone)",,,,,,,
,,"SEO for Mobile Phones (Plone, Responsive)",,,,,,,
,,"Guide mobile users accurately (Plone, Responsive)",,,,,,,
,,Promotions and Google Analytics (Monthly),,,,,,,
,,"""Promote your website in the right ways""",,,,,,,
,,If-Modified-Since HTTP header,Make sure the web server supports the If-Modified-Since HTTP header. Saves bandwidth/caching,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,"<meta name =""author"" content =""Willy Widgets"">
 <meta name =""robots"" content =""follow,index"">",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,Optimize Js and CSS (also in Performance checklist),"JavaScript: Be careful that your page is not cluttered with too much JavaScript that, if not put in a separate file, can negatively impact SEO (just as it does with the CSS). Try using external JavaScript files instead.",,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,Persistent Links,"Persistent links: Often designers will create persistent links on a page. These could appear in a variety of locations, but persistent links are most frequently found in the footer. Persistent links are beneficial for both usability and SEO. There is one caveat: If persistent links appear on every page of the site, yet they link to a page with fewer than 300 unique words on it, search engines can discount the relevance of that page due to its similarity to other pages that point to it, so be cautious in selecting your persistent links.",,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,

,,SEO (external),"The following page is the exhaustive list of time-tested, industry standard best practices for SEO across leading search platforms. The Office of IT currently maintains these practices in an ongoing basis.",,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,SEARCH ENGINE RANKINGS (SER) PRACTICES,,,,,,,
,,EVERYTHING IN SEO PLUS:,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,Number of inbound links,Links on other quality Web sites (http://www.google.com/technology),,,,,,
,,Quality of inbound links,"Links pointing to your site should have the relevant keyword text in them, it will cause your page to be ranked higher in search engine results.",,,,,,
,,,"For example, a link with the text ""information technology college"" pointing at your site will cause your site to be listed earlier if a visitor searches for ""information technology college"" than if the link simply said ""click here"" or ""IST"".",,,,,,
,,,Good:,,,,,,
,,,"1. Penn State <a href=""http://ist.psu.edu"" title=""Penn State College of Information Sciences and Technology"" target=""new"">College of Information Sciences and Technology</a>",,,,,,
,,,"2. <a href=""http://ist.psu.edu"" title=""Penn State College of Information Sciences and Technology"" target=""new"">information technology college</a>",,,,,,
,,,Not so good:,,,,,,
,,,"1. <a href=""http://ist.psu.edu"" title=""Penn State College of Information Sciences and Technology"" target=""new"">Click here</a>",,,,,,
,,,"2. <a href=""http://ist.psu.edu"" title=""Penn State College of Information Sciences and Technology"" target=""new"">information technology college</a>",,,,,,
